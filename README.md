A tutorial and sample code for running a pytorch nerual network using c++ on Nvidia jetson nano computer

# Author 

Dr. Longhao Qian

# How to use

- read this tutorial about how to correctly install pytorch c++ lib on jetson nano

- run the following command to verify whether pytorch c++ lib function correctly

- run to train a simple neural network and save the trained network to ``.pt`` weights file.

- run to compile the ``src/pytorchTest/pytorch_load_test.cpp`` and ``src/pytorchTest/pytorch_load_test_gpu.cpp`` to get the execution files.

- run to and observe the results

# CMake settings
